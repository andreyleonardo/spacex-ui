This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# SpaceX UI | React + Apollo-Client Example

This is a [React](http://reactjs.org/) + [Apollo](http://apollographql.com/) application that calls a GraphQL server that connects with [SpaceX API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2025350/RWaEzAiG) and displays SpaceX launches information.

This is just a POC (proof of concept), so a few tests could be missing, but I'll try to add as many tests cases as possible to understand how to test React + Apollo apps.

## Setup

To run this app you'll need the [GraphQL Server](https://github.com/andreyleonardo/spacex-graphql).

### Install Dependencies

Run `yarn or npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
